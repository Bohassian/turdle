* A suggestion on how to dev on Turdle

this project is an opportunity to learn a thing or two while hacking on
a silly and brilliant idea. one of those things is "containers". a project
provided with a container promises a consistent development experience
from one machine to another. yet, i (grant) have never administered one
or felt guided in the process of even being a container user.

so this project is being developed from the start with a container.

* Docker Containers

docker is the application that seems to have popularized containers recently.
its common at work, so we'll start off with this. there are tons of pre-made
container images (which i imagine are like ISOs?) including ones prebuilt to
support ruby. you can customize an image with a script called a Dockerfile.

** Dockerfile

This snippet is all we currently need. ~FROM ruby:3.1.1~ says to use this
image from the internet, built with Ruby version 3.1.1. its base is actually
a Debian image, so we see commands to ~apt~ for installing packages required
for Rails (except postgresql instead of sqlite3).

#+begin_src dockerfile :tangle Dockerfile
  FROM ruby:3.1.1
  RUN apt-get update -qq && apt-get install -y nodejs postgresql-client yarn
  WORKDIR /turdle
  COPY . /turdle
  RUN bundle cache
  RUN bundle install
  RUN ln -s /turdle/.rubocop.yml /root/.rubocop.yml
#+end_src

I'm not entirely sure about ~WORKDIR~ but i think it creates the directory
that the app will run from in the container. then we copy the contents of
the current directory (the whole turdle project) into that workdir.

~bundle cache~ avoids the need to reinstall from scratch when the containers
go up and down, as we'll have that process check if the Gemfile is modified
and install or update accordingly.

At the end we're symlinking the rubocop config in the app directory to the
container's root home directory to workaround a bug with picking up the
correct path for the configuration.

i'm sure this could be much more sophisticated, but ~docker compose~ lets
us to quite a bit of other work with a declarative yaml file.

** Defining Services with docker-compose.yml 

~docker compose~ is some evolution(?) of docker that lets you configure and run
various applications as services from the containers. as far as i can tell its
ergonomics? just a layer on top of docker, its syntax, and commands.

this project is currently defining three services: db, web, and lsp.

#+begin_src yaml :tangle docker-compose.yml :noweb yes
version: "3.9"
services:
  db:
    <<database-service>>
  web:
    <<web-service>>
#+end_src

*** db - the database service 😁

the database service is using another prebuilt docker image from the net.
i don't quite understand the volume here. then the environment will likely
be expanded to use your local environment file as needed.

#+name: database-service
#+begin_src yaml
    image: postgres
    volumes:
      - ./tmp/db:/var/lib/postgresql/data
    environment:
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: password
#+end_src

*** web - the rails app service

so it looks like build is saying the context is the current directory and we
want to build the image defined by the Dockerfile. when it starts up, run the
command ~bin/start-dev-server~ (documented elsewhere). the current directory
is mirrored at `/turdle` in the image (maybe COPY is not necessary?). port
3000 is exposed on your own local 3000 (another thing which could be customized
with environment variables). and it depends on the db service.

we also expose the default Solargraph LSP server port. there are instructions
below for running it and connecting your editor.

#+name: web-service
#+begin_src yaml
    build:
        context: .
        dockerfile: Dockerfile
    command: bin/start-dev-server
    volumes:
      - .:/turdle
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
      - "7658:7658"
    depends_on:
      - db
#+end_src

*** COMMENT lsp - the solargraph language server service

(seeming better to run it as an exec command in the web service)

this uses the same image as the web service. perhaps there's a better way to
do this, i don't quite grok it all yet. however this simply starts up the
solargraph server on its default port and binds it to the right ip for the
container->localhost network to function. and we expose the port.

#+name: lsp-service
#+begin_src yaml
    build:
        context: .
        dockerfile: Dockerfile
    command: bin/start-solargraph
    volumes:
      - .:/turdle
    ports:
      - "7658:7658"
#+end_src

** Installing and Caching Gems / ~start-dev-server~ command

The gems installed into the image by the Dockerfile will be dependent on the
Gemfile.lock at the time it was built. To keep things up to date as the Gemfile
changes, we'll write a script to run every time we start the ~web~ service.

#+begin_example ruby :tangle bin/start-dev-server
  #!/usr/bin/env ruby

  system "bundle check || bundle install"
  system "rm -f tmp/pids/server.pid"
  system "bin/rails s -p 3000 -b 0.0.0.0 -P tmp/pids/server.pid"
#+end_example

* Using Solargraph for Completion and Linting

Use ~bin/start-solargraph~ which will start the LSP server inside the web
container. You'll need to configure your editor client to connect to it, rather
than trying to start the server itself.

For VSCode, there's this client setting:

#+begin_src json
  "solargraph.transport": "external",
  "solargraph.externalServer": {
    "host": "localhost",
    "port": 7658
  }
#+end_src

More notes to come.
